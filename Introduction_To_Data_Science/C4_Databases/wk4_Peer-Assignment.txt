### Write queries to solve the following problems

# 1. Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table

%sql select count(*) from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA

# 2. Retrieve first 10 rows from the CRIME table

%sql select * from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA limit 10

# 3. How many crimes involve an arrest?

%sql select count(*) from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA where ARREST = 'TRUE'

# 4. Which unique types of crimes have been recorded at gas stations?

%sql select distinct PRIMARY_TYPE from CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA where LOCATION_DESCRIPTION like 'GAS STATION'

# 5. In the CENSUS_DATA table list all community areas whose names start with the letter 'B'

%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME from CENSUS_DATA where COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME like 'B%'

# 6. Which schools in Community Areas 10-15 are healthy school certified?

%sql select NAME_OF_SCHOOL, HEALTHY_SCHOOL_CERTIFIED, COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS \
	where HEALTHY_SCHOOL_CERTIFIED = 'Yes' and COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER between 10 and 15

# 7. What is the average school safety score?

%sql select avg(SAFETY_SCORE) from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS

# 8. List the top 5 community areas by average college enrollment, i.e. number of students

%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, avg(COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT) AS AVERAGE_ENROLLMENT \
   from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS \
   group by COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME \
   order by AVERAGE_ENROLLMENT desc \
   fetch first 5 rows only
   
# 9. Use a sub-query to determine which community areas has the least value for school safety score

%sql select COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, SAFETY_SCORE from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS \
   where SAFETY_SCORE = \
       (select min(SAFETY_SCORE) from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS)

# 10. Find the per capita income of the community area which has a school safety score of 1

%sql select CPS.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, CPS.SAFETY_SCORE, CD.PER_CAPITA_INCOME \
	from CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS as CPS, CENSUS_DATA as CD \
    where CPS.SAFETY_SCORE = 1 and CPS.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME = upper(CD.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME)
