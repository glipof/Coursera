Question 2
Below is the adjacency list of a graph. What is the minimum number of edges we must add to this graph in order to make each node balanced? (You may add duplicate edges connecting the same two nodes, but do not add new nodes.)

1 -> 2,3,5	(out 3, in 0)
2 -> 4		(out 1, in 2)
3 -> 2,5	(out 2, in 1)
4 -> 1,2,5	(out 3, in 0)
5 -> 3		(out 1, in 3)
1 point

Nodes 1 and 4 have no incoming edges (in-degree = 0), while nodes 2, 3, and 5 have no outgoing edges (out-degree = 0). To make each node balanced, we need to add edges to nodes 1 and 4 to increase their in-degrees and add edges to nodes 2, 3, and 5 to increase their out-degrees.

- 5 (WRONG)

1 -> 2,3,5	(out 3, in 2)
2 -> 1,4	(out 2, in 3)
3 -> 2,5	(out 2, in 2)
4 -> 1,2,5	(out 3, in 2)
5 -> 3,4	(out 2, in 2)

- 4 (WRONG)

Language from Step 1.1 Euler's Theorem:
Consider an ant, whom we will call Leo, walking along the edges of an Eulerian cycle. Every time Leo enters a node of this graph by an edge, he is able to leave this node by another, unused edge. Thus, in order for a graph to be Eulerian, the number of incoming edges at any node must be equal to the number of outgoing edges at that node. We define the indegree and outdegree of a node v (denoted in(v) and out(v), respectively) as the number of edges leading into and out of v. A node v is balanced if in(v) = out(v), and a graph is balanced if all its nodes are balanced. Because Leo must always be able to leave a node by an unused edge, any Eulerian graph must be balanced. The figure below shows a balanced graph and an unbalanced graph.
