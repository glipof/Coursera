Question 4
Which of the following motif-finding algorithms is guaranteed to find an optimum solution? In other words, which of the following are not heuristics? (Select all that apply.)
2 points

- GibbsSampler
- BruteForceMotifSearch (XXX)
- GreedyMotifSearch (without pseudocounts)
- MedianString (XXX)


5.
Question 5
Assume we are given the following strings Dna:

TGACGTTC
TAAGAGTT
GGACGAAA
CTGTTCGC

Then, assume that RandomizedMotifSearch begins by randomly choosing the following 3-mers Motifs of Dna:

TGA
GTT
GAA
TGT

What are the 3-mers after one iteration of RandomizedMotifSearch?  In other words, what are the 3-mers Motifs(Profile(Motifs), Dna)?  Please enter your answer as four space-separated strings.
