5. (CORRECTED)
Question 5
Consider the following motif matrix:

CTCGATGAGTAGGAAAGTAGTTTCACTGGGCGAACCACCCCGGCGCTAATCCTAGTGCCC
GCAATCCTACCCGAGGCCACATATCAGTAGGAACTAGAACCACCACGGGTGGCTAGTTTC
GGTGTTGAACCACGGGGTTAGTTTCATCTATTGTAGGAATCGGCTTCAAATCCTACACAG

Which of the following 7-mers is a median string for this motif matrix? (Select all that apply.)
2 points

- Redone code to return multiple strings = ['GTAGGAA', 'TAGTTTC', 'GAACCAC', 'AATCCTA']

1st try was, missed 'GTAGGAA'.
- GATGAGT
- GTAGGAA
- AATCCTA (XXX)
- GTCAGCG
- AACGCTG
- TCTGAAG

2nd try was, missed 'GAACCAC'; 'AACGCTG' was wrong.
- CGTGTAA
- AATCCTA (XXX)
- AACGCTG (XXX)
- GAACCAC
- GGTTACT
- ATAACGG

3rd try below
- AACGCTG
- GTCAGCG
- AATCCTA (XXX)
- TCTGAAG
- GTAGGAA (XXX)
- GATGAGT

6. (WRONG)
Question 6
Consider the following profile matrix Profile:

A:  0.4  0.3  0.0  0.1  0.0  0.9
C:  0.2  0.3  0.0  0.4  0.0  0.1
G:  0.1  0.3  1.0  0.1  0.5  0.0
T:  0.3  0.1  0.0  0.4  0.5  0.0

Compute Pr(AAGTTC|Profile). (Express your answer as a decimal and do not round your answer.)
