1.
Question 1
   This could be a representation of a heavy chain ______.
1 point

- gene in a germ cell
XXXX - gene during rearrangement
- gene during λ light chain gene rearrangement
- primary message transcript
- processed message

Question 2
                 This photograph shows a model of the DNA at the end of one of the
regions during gene rearrangement.  The
yellow arrow points to a ______ - stranded region that includes bases from the
__________ region(s).    
1 point

XXXX - single;
            palindromic
- single;
            one- or two-turn
- single;
            palindromic and one- or two-turn
- double;
           palindromic
WRONG - double;
           one- or two-turn
- double;
           palindromic and one- or two-turn


3.
Question 3
     Consider a single mature heavy chain peptide.  How
many CDR loops in the heavy peptide show variability that arose from DNA
changes during the gene rearrangement? 
How CDR loops show variability arising from somatic hypermutation? 
1 point

- 1; 1
- 1; 3
- 2; 1
WRONG - 2; 3
WRONG - 3; 1
WRONG - 3; 3

HINT: The junctions between the D and V on one side and J on the other
all contribute information to the third loop only.  Somatic hypermutation is directed to the DNA
that codes for all three loops. 


4.
Question 4
    This
diagram shows the sub-parts of the recombination signal sequences of the
variable and joining regions of the kappa light gene. All of the nucleotides of
part(s) labeled ______ will be removed from the gene during rearrangement.
1 point

- C only
- A and B only
- A, B, and D only
- B and D only
XXXX - B, C, and D only
- A, B, C and D – The V and the J will connect directly to each other.


5.
Question 5
    Which of these choices might represent a message precursor that could be spliced to
produce a peptide with a membrane span?
1 point

- 1.
- 2.
XXXX - 3.
WRONG - 4.
- 5.


6.
Question 6
   Thymus-independent B cells cannot
________.
1 point

- secrete antibodies
WRONG - respond to pathogenic patterns using toll-like receptors
- rearrange their genes during development
XXXX - produce G class antibodies
- bind to protein antigens


7.
Question 7
      N-nucleotide
addition adds nucleotides to the junctions between the _______.
1 point

- The V and the J of light chain genes
- The V and the D of heavy chain genes
- The D and the J of heavy chain genes
XXXX - B and C
- A and C


8.
Question 8
   Immature B cells in the bone marrow undergo apoptosis if
they _________.  Mature, naive B cells
undergo apoptosis if they __________.
1 point

XXXX - bind antigen;           do not bind antigen
WRONG - bind antigen;           bind antigen
WRONG - do not bind antigen;    bind antigen
- do not bind antigen;    do not bind antigen

9.
Question 9
     In the drawing, the tiny golden lightning bolt indicates the _______ and the tiny
red stop signs indicate signals for _________.
1 point

WRONG - activated promoter;     class switching
- activated promoter;     transcriptional (RNA) termination
WRONG - activated promoter;     translational (peptide) termination
- RSS heptamer;            class switching
WRONG - RSS heptamer;            transcriptional (RNA) termination
- RSS heptamer;            translational (peptide) termination

HINT: The lightning bolt indicates the upstream boundary of the L,
which is the location of the promoter. 
The stop signs are for message termination, the protein termination
codons will be in the exons upstream from the yellow and red regions indicating
addition of the polyA tail.  Class switch
signals are the diagonal striped regions upstream from the constant region that
gets removed. 


10.
Question 10
 The above diagram show the unrearranged heavy chain gene.  This gene will class switch to code for a G1
antibody (usingCγ1), after combining VL H40, DH2, JH1
to form the region coding for the variable domain.  Arrow point to these regions. Which of the
following gene regions will be removed from the DNA before this gene is
transcribed into an mRNA precursor?
1 point

- No VLH regions;   DH1 and 3;       no JH regions;        Cα1 through Cα2 
- No VLH regions;   DH1 and 3;       JH2 through 5;       Cα1 through Cα2
XXXX - No VLH regions;   DH1 and 3;       no JH regions;        Cμ, Cδ and Cγ3
WRONG - VLH10;                  DH1 and 3;       JH2 through 5;       Cα1 through Cα2
- VLH10;                  DH1 and 3;       no J2 regions;        Cμ, Cδ and Cγ3
- VLH10;                  DH1 and 3;       JH2 through 5;       Cμ, Cδ and Cγ3
