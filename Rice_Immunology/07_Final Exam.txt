3)     Codes for a membrane-spanning heavy chain that can associate with surrogate light chains
4)     Codes for a soluble antibody, but one that is a rarely observed in the plasma.

Match the message
with the characteristic trait of the peptide it codes for.

1 point

- 1)X     2)Y      3)Z      4)W

XXXX - 1)X     2)Z      3)W     4)Y


29.
Question 29

1 point

- are found
     near each other on the same chromosome
- begin
     rearrangement by joining a V to a J region
XXXX - will have the
     extra J regions copied into the primary transcript
WRONG - will have the
     extra upstream VL regions copied into the primary transcript
- have two
     membrane-spanning exons at the 3’ end of each of the constant regions

NOTE: A-  They’re on different chromosomes.
      B-  The heavy chain starts with D to J.
      C-  Yes, and then spliced out in both cases.
      D-  Neither one does this.
      E-  Light chains never have membrane-spanning exons.


30.
Question 30
   Which of these choices indicates the correct order of possible events in B-cell
development between the synthesis of Ig α and β and the synapse between the
B-cell and the T cell.

I.   synthesis of surrogate light chains

II.  synthesis of m (M class) heavy chains

III. synthesis of δ (D class) heavy chains

IV.  synthesis of κ light chains

V. negative selection again self-recognition

1 point

XXXX - II,
    I,       IV,
   V,     III

WRONG - II,
    V,     I,
      IV,    III

- IV,
   I,       II,
    III,    V

- IV,
   II,     V,
    I,       III

NOTE: This looks annoyingly complicated, but it’s really not.  The choices start with either the synthesis
of M chains or light chains, so you can ignore C and D.

The next choice is between synthesis of surrogate chain and negative selection.  Since you must have the real light chains,
and their rearrangement is signaled by the receptor with the surrogate light chains, you’ll be able to stop here and pick A.

A gives the initial source of the variation.
C refers to nucleotides that will eventually code for some of the amino acids in Loop 3.
D points out that the same heavy chain will have a different recognition properties  depending on the
characteristics of the light.
E Somatic hypermutation is specifically directed at the nucleotides that code for the CDR.

somatic hypermutation?     

5.21 Somatic Hypermutation
 - Heavy Chain (A [pink], B [red squiggles] and C [green])
 - Light Chain (D [to yellow area], E [pink] and F [red squiggles])

1 point

- A and B only
WRONG - A, B, E and F, but not C and D
- C only
- D only
WRONG - C and D only (not A, B, E, or F)
- All six

NOTE: While variations due to N nucleotide addition wind up in C only, and variations due to P nucleotide addition wind up
in D and C, the mutational events occur in the V regions as well, directed to the areas that code for loops 1 and 2.

Question 40
   If you view affinity maturation as a form of rapid evolution, driven by excess
reproduction and survival of the fittest, the “fittest” B cells are those that
are able to _______.  

1 point

light.  The selection process allows B cells with the best antigen-gathering capacity to survive and those are the
cells with the most effective receptors.
