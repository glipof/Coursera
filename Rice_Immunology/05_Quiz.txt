1.
Question 1
      Most of the unique variability of the Ig genes arises from ________.
1 point

- multiple options in splicing the Ig heavy and light messages
XXXX - rearrangements in the gene regions coding for the variable Ig domains
- random combination of heavy and light chains
- duplications of V-L and J regions during differentiation of the bone marrow
- selection of various constant regions from heavy and light chain IgG genes


2.
Question 2
     There are _______ nm (nanometers) in a millimeter.
1 point

- 10x2
- 10x3
- 10x4
XXXX - 10x6
- 10x9


3.
Question 3
      Which of these might represent a rearranged light chain gene?
1 point

XXXX - 1.
- 2.
- 3.
- 4.
- 5.

Question 4
     During heavy chain rearrangement, the nine-base AT-rich sequence of the RSS functions
to ______.
1 point

XXXX - participate
     in the process that brings a V and a D region together
- provide the
     recognition that prevents the V from joining directly the J
WRONG - contribute
     bases to the joint sequences that connect a D to a J
- allow the
     precise removal of C regions during class switching
- determine
     whether or not membrane-spanning exons will get spliced into the processed message

COMMENT: Recall that the single strand loops arose from the 7–base
palindromes.  This means that the rest of the RSS will not wind up in the finished joint. 
So it must participate in controlling the process in some way.  B is wrong because that is the function of
the one and two urn signals.

Question 5
      This picture shows two RSS signals.  During
joining of the coding regions they control, the nucleotides of which ones will
be removed and recycled?
1 point

- C only
WRONG - B and D only
WRONG - B, C, and D only
- B, C, D, and parts of A and E
- B, C, D, and all of A and E

COMMENT: This is basically regurgitation from the lecture to make sure you understand which part
gets referred to when describing rearrangement.


6.
Question 6
     A B cell with this heavy chain gene could make class_______, assuming no further
changes to the gene.
1 point

- A1 antibodies
- A1 Ig receptors
- A2 antibodies
- A2 Ig receptors
XXXX - A and B
WRONG - A and C
- A, B, C and D

COMMENT: The constant domains immediately downstream from the rearranged variable regions is the α1, with is the only
usable region.  However it can be spliced to produce with a membrane-bound Ig receptor of a soluble antibody.


7.
Question 7
    Which of these loops owe some of their variation to N-nucleotide addition?    
1 point

XXXX - C only
- D only
WRONG - D and C
- A, B, and C
- All of them (A, B, C, D, E, and F)

COMMENT: Only the heavy chain has N-nucleotide
addition, which occurs at the VDJ joints, not in the interior of the V gene region.


8.
Question 8
      When a B cell class switches it may remove the sequence(s) for ________.
1 point

- the
ε without removing all the γs
- the
α1 without removing the γ2 and γ4
- the
µ region without removing the δ
WRONG - the
δ region without removing the µ
WRONG - the
γ3 and γ1 without removing the µ and δ

COMMENT: You can’t remove a sequence without removing everything between
it and the variable region as well.


9.
Question 9
      What is the function of the 5’ leader sequence of the heavy chain gene?
1 point

- It
binds RNA polymerase.
- It
codes for the amino acids that anchor the mature peptide in the membrane.
XXXX - It
codes for the amino acids that target the growing peptide to the inside of the
endoplasmic reticulum.
- It
contains the RSS that allows the V to attach to the D gene region.
- It
has a splicing sequence that attaches the V region to one of the available C
regions in a mature message.


10.
Question 10
     Gene rearrangement results in the addition of bases at the joint due to N nucleotide
addition.  What happens to these bases?
1 point

- They are
     transcribed into a primary message transcript and deleted during message
     splicing.
- They are
     transcribed and remain in the processed message, but they are skipped over
     during translation.
- They are
     transcribed and remain in the processed message and are translated into the
     amino acid sequence at the C terminus of the peptide.
XXXX - They are
     transcribed and remain in the processed message, and are translated into
     the amino acid sequence of the hypervariable loop that connects the V, D
     and J regions.
