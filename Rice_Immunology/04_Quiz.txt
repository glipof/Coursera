to _________.
1 point

      recognize pathogenic threats
- soluble;
      signal from one self-cell to another

Question 3
     A B cell has both toll-like receptors and immunoglobulin receptors on its
surface.  A pathogenic fungus activates
both of these receptors.  The activation
process differs in that only the TLR
recognizes _______.
1 point

- protein
     regions with shapes and charges specific to that fungal strain
XXXX - characteristics
     of wall materials common to many types of fungi
- double
     stranded RNAs specific to fungi
- the
     pathogenic signals by binding together two trans-membrane receptors
WRONG - the pathogen
     and then sets off a response cascade involving phosphorylation

Question 9
As a cancer researcher seeking to develop a new immune therapy, you have
identified a cell surface receptor that blocks the induction of apoptosis in
damaged malignant cells.  You have
successfully induced mice to make antibodies that will attach to and block this
receptor protein.  You harvest plasma
cells secreting these antibodies.  Use
the Roman numerals of the choices to indicate what you should do next, in the
correct order of performance.

I.    Isolate individual cells producing just
one kind of antibody to one of the receptor epitopes.

IV.   Mix
B cells secreting this antibody with myeloma cells in a medium that encourages
cells to fuse.  

III.  Grow
the antibody-producing cells in a medium containing thymine, aminopterin and
hypoxanthine.

II.   Engineer
the antibody-producing cells to make a human, not a mouse antibody.
