Question 3

supply the signals that determine class switching.  These cells, in turn, decide what kind of signal
to send out based on the information that they have received from _________.
1 point

XXXX - TH cells;                        sentinel dendritic cells
- TH cells;                        follicular dendritic cells

4.
Question 4
     As you recover from a flu (or other acute) infection by a new pathogen, you will
begin to make ______ memory cells.  This
will allow you to begin making large quantities of soluble ________
antibodies to this pathogen within 4 days of a subsequent infection.
1 point

- M/D only; 	  M only
- M/D only;       M and D
- M/D and G;      G only
XXXX - M/D and G;      M and G only
- M/D and G;      M, D and G


5.
Question 5
       For all B cells, the first signal for activation comes from the binding of
antigen.  However the second signal for thymus dependent B cells comes from
_______ and for thymus independent B cells, it comes from ______.
1 point

- CD4;                         interaction with TCRs 
WRONG - CD4;                         activation of toll-like receptors
WRONG - activation of toll-like receptors;              CD40R
- activation of toll-like receptors;              CD4
- CD154 (CD40L);                                  CD40R
- CD154 (CD40L);                                 activation of toll-like receptors 

NOTE: Basically a double factoid question from the lecture. 


6.
Question 6
      During affinity maturation, B-cells will undergo somatic hypermutation in the ______
zone and selection for improved CDR binding in the _______ zone. After these
processes the TH cell may direct the B cell to leave and head to the
site of an infection and secrete antibodies there, which will cause the B cell
to _________.
1 point

- light; dark;                   make more rough ER
- light; dark;                   class switch
- light; dark;                   up-regulate splicing enzyme that add membrane spanning instructions
- dark; light;                   class switch
XXXX - dark; light;                   make more rough ER
WRONG - dark; light;                   up-regulate splicing enzyme that add membrane spanning instructions

NOTE: The first part is basically a factoid- somatic hypermutation in the dark, selection
in the light.  Once a cell begins to make antibody, it must enlarge and greatly increase it RER so that it can produce
quantities of secreted proteins, instead of just several hundred receptors. It need not class switch to do this.


7.
Question 7
                 This drawing represents a cell involved in B cell determination. The little yellow lumps on the cell represent
________.    

1 point

- cytokine signals
- MHC I molecules displaying antigen 
XXXX - antigen-antibody complexes
- platelets
- the first blebbing events of apoptosis
- attached TH cells


8.
Question 8
     Thymus dependent and thymus independent B cells are similar in that they BOTH
________.

1 point

XXXX - bind antigen with receptors whose genes have been rearranged in the bone marrow 
WRONG - require the activation of Toll-like receptors on the B-cell surface
- can respond to foreign antigen within three days of first exposure
- are highly likely to undergo class switching
- occur as both memory and plasma cells

NOTE: The wrong answer choices
capture differences: B and C for TI, D and E for ordinary B cells.


9.
Question 9
       When both thymus-dependent and thymus-independent B cells begin activation, they
cross link the Ig receptors and generate an internal signaling sequence.  In both cases the sequence begins with the
_________ of the ________.

1 point

- phosphorylation of ITAMs;       Ig receptor
XXXX - phosphorylation of ITAMs;       Ig α/β co-receptors
- hydrolysis of the C terminal;   Ig receptor
- hydrolysis of the C terminal;   Ig α/β co-receptors


10.
Question 10

antibody, in order to sense _______.

1 point

- the effectiveness of antibodies in current use
- pathogens, so they can phagocytized them
- the class of antibodies currently available
- the seriousness of an infection 
XXXX - when sufficient antibodies are present
