1.
Question 1
    The Ig α and Ig β peptides are important in which of the following processes?
1 point

XXXX - signaling cross-linking of the Ig receptors
WRONG - preventing apoptosis of B cells in the bone marrow
- binding to carbohydrate antigen
- presenting antigen to B cells
- forming part of the TCR

NOTE: Because the Ig receptor has a very short cytoplasmic domain, it does not have the
sequences needed to pick up phosphate and set off the internal signaling cascade. 


2.
Question 2
    Consider B lineage cell development in primary and secondary adaptive immune organs.
Class switching takes place in _____ organs, gene rearrangement in _______
organs and affinity maturation in _______ organs.
1 point

- primary;           primary;           secondary
- primary;           secondary;        primary
WRONG - primary;           secondary;        secondary
- secondary;        primary;           primary
XXXX - secondary;        primary;           secondary
- secondary;        secondary;        primary

NOTE: Class switching takes place in the lymph nodes (2o), rearrangement in the
bone marrow (1o) and affinity maturation on the lymph nodes (2o) 


3.
Question 3
     An immature member of the B-cell lineage, developing in the bone marrow, displays
a surface receptor with two heavy chains attached to surrogate light
chains.  This receptor can receive information that triggers ______ in/of the cell.
1 point

XXXX - rearrangement of a light chain gene
- mutation of the heavy chain hypervariable loops
WRONG - apoptosis if the receptor binds antigen
- clonal expansion if the receptor binds antigen
- exit from the bone marrow

NOTE: The function of the surrogate light chains is to build an Ig receptor with a functioning heavy
chain, and this receptor does not bind antigen, but rather signals the go-ahead
for light chain gene rearrangement.


4.
Question 4
   The first antibodies released in response to infection by a new pathogen will be _____ class antibodies.
1 point

- D
XXXX - M
- approximately
equal amounts of D and M
- G
- approximately
equal amounts of M and G

5.
Question 5
      It takes _______ days after exposure to a
new pathogen to mount an adaptive response and the plasma cells that
release these antibodies develop from _______ B cell.
1 point

WRONG - 1 to 3; naïve
- 1 to 3; memory 
XXXX - 4 to 7; naïve
- 4 to 7; memory

NOTE:  If it’s a brand new pathogen, there won’t be any memory cells
that recognize it.  Thus it’s going to
take 4 to 7 days (and maybe more) to get an effective Ig identified and go into
production. 


6.
Question 6
     TH cells use ______ to provide the second signal necessary to stimulate B cell.
1 point

- B7
- phosphate
- processed antigen
XXXX - CD40L
- CD4


7.
Question 7
   A developing B cell enters a germinal center. 
The cell will ________ immunoglobulin receptors from its surface, begin
to divide, and produce descendants, most of which will make an antibody ____ at
binding to the antigen than did antibody of the founder cell.
1 point

- remove; better
XXXX - remove; worse
- extend; better
WRONG - extend; worse

NOTE: The cell recycles its receptors so that it can later display new Ig receptors made
from the mutated instructions.  Alas,
random mutation usually produces a worse set of instruction to make a particular
protein.


8.
Question 8
      In this secondary follicle, the arrow labeled I points to the site of _____.
1 point

WRONG - gene rearrangement of the heavy chain gene
- negative selection
- hypermutation of the B cell variable gene regions
WRONG - interaction of B, T and follicular dendritic cells
- activation of B cells by antigen

NOTE: The dark zone is the region of cell division and the light zone is the region of
selection (and follicular dendritic cells) 


9.
Question 9
       The differentiation of B cells to memory cells is mostly likely to be promoted by _________.
1 point

- inflammatory cytokines
WRONG - signals from follicular
     dendritic cells
WRONG - signals from fat cells in the
     bone marrow
- rising levels of foreign
     antigen
- declining levels of foreign
     antigen

NOTE: Memory cells tend to arise at the end of an infection.  Thus
rising levels of antigen and inflammatory cytokines would promote the
development of more effector cells. Fats cells operate on B cells during development.


10.
Question 10
 BSAP is a _______ found in ________.
1 point

- cytokine
receptor;         developing B cells
- cytokine
receptor;         plasma cells
XXXX - transcription
factor;       developing B cells
- transcription
factor;       plasma cells
