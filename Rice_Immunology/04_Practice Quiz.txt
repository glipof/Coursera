Week 4
Practice Quiz 4


1.
Question 1
     Pretend you are a high school teacher in the USA. 
You have brilliant, motivated students and a hefty budget provided by
some incredibly successful bake sales (We can all dream.)  Your students want to study how genes affect
neural development in humans, and they need a model system. You refuse to spend
time filing paperwork with government agencies designed to protect mammals and
birds, but you want an organism that can provide information relevant to human
neurobiology.  You advise your students
to study _____.
1 point

- each other
- fruit flies
XXXX - zebrafish
WRONG - mice
- C. elegans (roundworms)

Question 2
   These pictures show the model of an immunoglobulin domain before folding and after
folding, wrapped with a twist tie.  The
yellow regions of the pipe cleaner represent _______ and the wire running
through the whole pipe cleaner represents the _________.
1 point

 - hydrophobic
amino acid R groups;     peptide backbone 
WRONG - hydrophobic
amino acid R groups;     disulfide bond
- hydrophilic
amino acid R groups;      peptide backbone 
WRONG - hydrophilic
amino acid R groups;      disulfide bond

5.
Question 5
   In this drawing of an Ig receptor complex, the lines indicate portions of the
cytoplasmic co-receptor tails that will _______ during B cell activation.
1 point

to the cytoskeleton

and activate transcription factors
- be
hydrolyzed and removed
- have
methyls added to them
- have
carboxyls added to them
XXXX - have
phosphates added to them


6.
Question 6
                 The structure represent by this drawing might be attach to _____ class
antibodies, and could be separated from them intact by treatment with ________.    
1 point

- M
only;           mercaptoethanol
- M
only;           pepsin
- A
only;            mercaptoethanol
- A
only;            pepsin
XXXX - M
and A;         mercaptoethanol
- M
and A;         pepsin

Question 7
The diagram below illustrates the two structural categories of antibody
subunits.  The left-hand drawing (I, with
the flexible hinge) might be the basic unit of a (n) _______ class antibody and
the one on the left (II, with the rigid bend) might be a (n) _______ class
antibody.
1 point

- M; G
- E; M
XXXX - A; E
- D; G
- G; D


8.
Question 8
      Adjuvants improve the effectiveness of antibody production in response to vaccines by
______.
1 point

- crosslinking
     Ig receptors
XXXX - binding to
     pattern recognition receptors
- phosphorylating
     Ig α and β immunoglobulin co-receptors
- increasing
     the amount of endoplasmic reticulum in the cell
- aiding the
     dispersal of immunogenic molecules form the site of injection


9.
Question 9
  After B cells and myeloma cells are allowed to fuse, the cells are cultured in HAT
medium so that only fused cells can survive and grow.  The function of the hypoxanthine and thymine in the HAT medium is to ______.
1 point

WRONG - prevent
synthesis by the de novo pathway
- supply
the de novo pathway with precursors
- prevent
synthesis by the salvage pathway
XXXX - supply
the salvage pathway with precursors


10.
Question 10
   Homeland Security needs a supply of monoclonal antibodies to metallo-organic compounds,
such as dimethyl mercury. These are toxic substances too small to crosslink the
surface Igs of a B cell. They might be able to induce mice to make antibodies
to metallo-organic compounds by ______.
1 point

- blocking the
     liver and kidneys from excreting them
- having the
     mice inhale them in vaporized water droplets
- feeding them
     to the mice in a single high concentration dose
XXXX - binding them
     to egg-white albumen and injecting the complex
- feeding them
     to the mice in low concentrations over an extended period of time
