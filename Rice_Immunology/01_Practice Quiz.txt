Question 1
      The
birds and reptiles in this picture have _________.

1 point

XXXX - basically the
     same forms of immunity as mammals

- basically the
     same forms of immunity as mammals, and additional forms of immunity found
     only in the reptilian/dinosaur/bird lineage

- those forms
     of immunity found in invertebrate chordates and fish, but not those found
     in mammals

- those forms
     of immunity found in plants and fruit flies, but not those found in
     mammals

Question 2
      Consider
the difference between the mortality rate of the typical First World town and
that mortality rate of a typical Third World village.  Supplying the villagers which of the
following would be most effective in reducing the relative mortality rate of
the village?
1 point

- milk, meat and fresh fruits and vegetables

XXXX - proper sewage disposal and uncontaminated
drinking water

- a clinic dispensing condoms and
antibiotics

- extremely effective treatments for cancer
and heart disease

- mosquito netting and window screens


3.
Question 3
   Good
nutrition is important in preventing infectious disease because _________.
1 point

- in Third
     World countries, most diseases are acquired through contaminated food

- dairy foods
     provide direct sources of antibodies

XXXX - supplying the
     immune system takes lots of energy and vitamins

- good food is
     less likely to lead to allergic and autoimmune responses

- Actually,
     enough antibiotics and it doesn’t much matter what you eat.

Question 4
 The
pathogens pictured here are _____. 

1 point

- prokaryotic
and have cell walls

- eukaryotic
and have cell walls

- eukaryotic,
unicellular and do not have cell walls

- eukaryotic
and multicellular 

XXXX - in
a strict sense, not really alive


5.
Question 5
    Mounting
a Treg response to bacteria is most likely to result in _______.
1 point

XXXX - no
defensive response against the bacteria

- restraining
bacteria from freely multiplying

- death
of the bacteria

- death of local self-tissue

- both C and D


6.
Question 6
 An advantage of innate recognition over adaptive
recognition is that it ______.
1 point

- does not trigger an inflammatory response

- can distinguish a wider range of specific molecules

- targets specific strains of potential pathogens

XXXX - works much more quickly

- produces memory cells that result in more rapid future responses


7.
Question 7
     The immune system has a wide variety of recognition and attack mechanisms that
specifically target bacteria.  Humans
have a harder time fending off fungi, trypanosomes and viruses because these
pathogens _______.
1 point

- are
not truly alive, making them hard to kill

XXXX - reproduce
using biochemistry similar or identical to that used by the host

- unlike
bacteria, do not have cell walls, an excellent target for disruption

- are
more heat-resistant than bacteria and less likely to be compromised by fever


8.
Question 8
     This
adorable baby illustrated what point supporting the importance of good public
health?
1 point

XXXX - Diarrheal
diseases in infancy may have long-term consequences to a child’s cognitive
development.

- Diapers
are important in preventing sewage contamination of drinking water.

- We
can identify emerging pathogens much more rapidly today because of DNA
sequencing and informatics technology.

- Breast
feeding is effective in preventing diseases in babies, especially in
undeveloped countries.


9.
Question 9
   Which
the following describes a recognition process most closely analogous to innate,
as opposed to adaptive, immune recognition?
1 point

- RUPD
identifies a thumbprint on a building entry keypad pressed shortly before a
prank email originates from that building, stating that Rice will close the
School of Engineering.

- A Rice
     undergraduate identifies someone who assaulted and robbed him from a
     series of mugshots of local convicted felons.

XXXX - RUPD
notices an individual pushing several bicycles at once toward a campus exit.

- DNA from a
     rape kit produces a match with a recently-released felon.

- HPD recovers
     a trove of stolen computers and returns them to their original owners by
     tracing the serial numbers.


10.
Question 10
   In general, a ______ response to a microbe
will kill it and may result in self-tissue damage and a _______ response will
interfere with the microbe’s growth and development, but will not necessarily
eliminate it.
