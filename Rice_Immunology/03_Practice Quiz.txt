1.
Question 1
      A “Coley toxin” can function to _______.
1 point

- decrease
the inflammatory response in a sick patient
XXXX - increase
the inflammatory response in a sick patient
- sterilize
surfaces in sickrooms
- poison
bacterial cells in phagolysosomes
- dislodge
parasites when secreted by eosinophils



2.
Question 2
      A person with a bacterial infection runs a fever of 102°
F (39 °C).  The fever is _____.
1 point

- harmful, because it is
high enough to cause brain damage.
- harmful, because bacteria
will divide faster at the high temperature
XXXX - helpful, because this
provides an environment more hostile to bacterial growth
- helpful, because
antibodies bind more effectively at higher temperatures
- neither helpful
nor harmful,
but rather just a side effect of cytokine signaling



3.

can assume, increased temperature) are most directly brought about by ________.
1 point

WRONG - neutrophil infiltration
- antibody action
XXXX - vascular changes
- clotting



9.
Question 9

the respiratory burst, that is, the O2
uptake by neutrophils and macrophages in response to phagocytosis?
1 point

will bind to inflamed epithelium
XXXX - It has granules that pick up acidic
and basic stains.
WRONG - It has receptors for antibody stems.
- It has a nucleus with a lobed
structure.
